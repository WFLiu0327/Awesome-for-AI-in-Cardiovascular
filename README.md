# The Awesome for Artificial Intelligence for Cardiovascular

In this Awesome project, we will organize and categorize the applications of artificial intelligence in cardiovascular diseases from three perspectives: Tasks (including classification, segmentation, detection, regression, etc.), Data types (including ECG, CMRI, CCTA, electronic reports, echocardiography, X-ray imaging, multi-modal data), and disease types (including cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, etc.).
